You came in my life little saviour
I catch butterflies when you enter
It's crazy what love can do
Now you got me singing my truth
You bring me calm through the chaos
When all the odds are against us
You'll have my all love
I need you to know now
Oh my darling
Am i falling?
I can't find the words to use
First my heart aches
Then my voice breaks
So i had to write it down for you
Oh my darling
What you started
Feels like i've got it all to lose
First the ground shakes
Years of mistakes
You've given me another life
So i'll live it for you
I gotta do it right for you
I'll let you fix all my damage
The bruises under the bandages
Lessons i had to feel
I hope them scars never heal
You bring me calm through the chaos
Someday this pain's gonna pay off
And you'll have all my love
I need you to know now
Oh my darling
Am i falling?
I can't find the words to use
First my heart aches
Then my voice breaks
So i had to write it down for you
Oh my darling
What you started
Feels like i've got it all to lose
First the ground shakes
Years of mistakes
You've given me another life
So i'll live it for you
I gotta do it right for you
